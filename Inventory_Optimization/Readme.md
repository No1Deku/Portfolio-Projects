# 📦 Inventory Optimization for Retail Chains

## 🧠 Project Overview

Retail chains often struggle to maintain optimal inventory levels—facing stockouts of high-demand items and overstocking of low-performing products. These inefficiencies lead to lost sales, increased holding costs, and poor customer satisfaction.

This project, **Inventory Optimization through Data-Driven Insights**, leverages advanced forecasting models, SQL analytics, and customer segmentation to build a robust inventory management system. By transforming raw retail data into actionable intelligence, the solution empowers retailers to make smarter decisions about stocking, pricing, and replenishment.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- **Demand Forecasting**  
  Predict store-level product demand using ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM models, incorporating external factors like weather, holidays, and promotions.

- **Category-Specific Inventory Strategies**  
  Identify high-demand categories prone to stockouts and low-performing categories that remain overstocked.

- **Regional Demand Optimization**  
  Detect geographic variations in demand and tailor stocking strategies accordingly.

- **Dynamic Pricing Insights**  
  Analyze the impact of pricing, discounts, and competitor strategies on sales and revenue.

- **Smarter Replenishment**  
  Recommend reorder points and quantities that balance customer satisfaction with reduced holding costs.

## 🔍 Data Science Workflow

### 1. Business Understanding
- **Problem**: Stockouts of popular items and overstock of low-demand products.
- **Objectives**:
  - Reduce lost sales
  - Minimize holding costs
  - Improve forecasting accuracy
  - Optimize pricing strategies

### 2. Data Understanding
- Perform EDA to uncover:
  - Seasonal and regional demand patterns
  - Stockout and overstock frequency
  - Impact of holidays, promotions, and weather

### 3. Data Preparation
- Handle missing values and encode categorical features
- Engineer lag features and event windows
- Structure time series data by Store-Product combinations

### 4. Modeling
- **Forecasting**:
  - ARIMA, Prophet (baseline)
  - LSTM / GRU (advanced)
- **Inventory Optimization**:
  - EOQ, Safety Stock, Reorder Point (ROP)
- **Pricing Models**:
  - Regression/XGBoost for price elasticity and promotion impact

### 5. Evaluation
- **Forecasting Metrics**: RMSE, MAE, MAPE
- **Inventory KPIs**:
  - % Stockouts Reduced
  - % Overstock Reduced
  - Inventory Turnover Ratio
- **Revenue Metrics**:
  - Revenue uplift
  - Profit margin improvement

### 6. Deployment
- **Dashboards** (Power BI / Streamlit):
  - Demand forecasts
  - Stockout/overstock heatmaps
  - Regional performance comparisons
- **Integration**:
  - Export CSVs for ERP systems
  - Automated reorder recommendations
