Store Layout Optimization using Market Basket Analysis
A comprehensive retail analytics framework that leverages Market Basket Analysis (MBA), co-purchase network modeling, and machine learning to optimize store layouts and improve customer purchasing patterns.
Project Overview
This project implements an automated retail analytics pipeline that analyzes customer transaction data to uncover purchasing patterns and provide actionable insights for store layout optimization. By combining association rule mining, network analysis, and predictive modeling, the framework enables data-driven decisions for product placement, promotional strategies, and inventory management.
Business Problem Statement
Challenge: Retailers struggle to optimize store layouts without understanding customer purchasing behaviors and product associations. Poor product placement leads to:

Missed cross-selling opportunities
Suboptimal customer flow through stores
Inefficient promotional strategies
Lost revenue from poorly positioned high-margin products

Solution: This automated MBA framework analyzes Point-of-Sale (POS) data to identify:

Products frequently purchased together
Optimal product placement strategies
Customer traffic patterns and purchasing behavior
Demand forecasting for improved inventory management

Key Business Insights and Applications
Association Rule Mining Results
Based on the analysis of grocery store transaction data, key findings include:
Strong Product Associations:

100% confidence rules: Customers purchasing frozen items + ready mix â also buy vegetables
High lift associations: Eyeliner + vegetables â fruits (strongest rule with highest lift)
Cross-category patterns: Color/sketch pencils + eraser â pencils (confidence: 100%)

Category-Level Insights:

Vegetable section dominance: Majority of strong association rules connect to vegetables
Bundle opportunities: 4-5 item bundles show highest confidence and support
Traffic patterns: Vegetable section generates highest customer traffic

Store Layout Optimization Recommendations
Primary Strategic Recommendations:

Vegetable Section as Anchor Point

Position high-margin products adjacent to vegetable section
Create promotional displays near vegetable area to capture maximum traffic
Use vegetable section as pathway to other store areas


Strategic Product Bundling

Bundle fruits with vegetables for cross-category promotion
Create spice and condiment displays near vegetable section
Position rice products in vegetable vicinity for convenience purchasing


Category Proximity Planning

Place complementary categories within easy reach
Avoid placing incompatible products (cleaning supplies) near food sections
Create logical shopping paths based on association strengths



Demand Forecasting Capabilities
Model Performance Metrics:

RMSE: Typically 15-25% of mean demand for stable products
RÂ² Score: 0.65-0.85 for products with consistent sales patterns
Feature Importance: Rolling averages typically show highest predictive power

Business Applications:

Inventory Optimization: Predict demand spikes for better stock planning
Promotional Planning: Identify optimal timing for product promotions
Layout Testing: Simulate placement changes before physical implementation
