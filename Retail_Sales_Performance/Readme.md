E-Commerce Retail Analytics Project
A comprehensive data analytics framework for transforming raw e-commerce transactional data into actionable business intelligence using Python, DuckDB, and advanced SQL techniques.
Project Overview
This project analyzes UK-based online retail data to deliver strategic insights across customer behavior, product performance, and revenue optimization. By leveraging a combination of SQL window functions, CTEs, and Python analytics, the framework provides production-ready business intelligence outputs for stakeholders.
Core Business Value Proposition
Customer-Centric Analytics: RFM segmentation with churn analysis to optimize retention campaigns
Product Performance Intelligence: Month-over-month and year-over-year growth analysis with contribution metrics
Operational Excellence: Production-ready data pipeline with automated CSV exports for dashboard integration
Technical Architecture
Technology Stack
python# Core Data Processing
import pandas as pd              # Data manipulation and analysis
import duckdb as db             # In-memory analytical database
import numpy as np              # Numerical computing

Data Pipeline Architecture
Raw CSV Data → Data Cleaning → Feature Engineering → Business Logic → Export Pipeline
     ↓              ↓               ↓                 ↓              ↓
Pandas Loading → DuckDB SQL → Time Features → Analytics Queries → CSV Outputs
Data Processing Workflow
Phase 1: Data Ingestion and Standardization
Initial Data Loading and Date Standardization:
python# Load and standardize the dataset
data = pd.read_csv("OnlineRetail.csv", encoding="ISO-8859-1")

# Critical date standardization for time-series analysis
data['InvoiceDate'] = pd.to_datetime(data['InvoiceDate'], errors='coerce', dayfirst=True)
data = data[data['InvoiceDate'].notnull()]  # Remove invalid dates
data['InvoiceDate'] = data['InvoiceDate'].dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')

# Remove records without customer identification
data = data.dropna(subset=['CustomerID'])
Phase 2: Data Quality Enhancement with SQL
Advanced Data Cleaning Using DuckDB:
sql-- Comprehensive data cleaning with missing description recovery
WITH cleaned_desc AS (
    SELECT 
        StockCode,
        MAX(Description) AS Real_Desc
    FROM data
    WHERE Description IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY StockCode
)
SELECT 
    d.InvoiceNo,
    d.StockCode,
    COALESCE(d.Description, r.Real_Desc) AS Description,
    d.InvoiceDate,
    CAST(d.Quantity AS INT) AS Quantity,
    CAST(d.UnitPrice AS DOUBLE) AS UnitPrice,
    d.CustomerID,
    d.Country,
    CAST(d.Quantity AS INT) * CAST(d.UnitPrice AS DOUBLE) AS Revenue
FROM data AS d
LEFT JOIN cleaned_desc AS r ON d.StockCode = r.StockCode
WHERE Quantity > 0 
  AND UnitPrice > 0
  AND COALESCE(d.Description, r.Real_Desc) IS NOT NULL
Key Data Quality Improvements:

Missing Description Recovery: Used StockCode-based lookup to fill missing product descriptions
Revenue Calculation: Implemented standardized Revenue = Quantity × UnitPrice
Data Validation: Filtered out negative quantities and zero prices
Type Standardization: Explicit casting to ensure numeric precision

Phase 3: Time-Series Feature Engineering
Temporal Feature Extraction:
python# Extract comprehensive time features for seasonality analysis
data['InvoiceDate'] = pd.to_datetime(data['InvoiceDate'])
data['Year'] = data['InvoiceDate'].dt.year
data['Month'] = data['InvoiceDate'].dt.month
data['Quarter'] = data['InvoiceDate'].dt.quarter
data['DayOfWeek'] = data['InvoiceDate'].dt.day_name()
Business Intelligence Modules
